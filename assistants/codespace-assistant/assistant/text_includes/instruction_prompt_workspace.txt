## Content Generation Capabilities

- **Text & Markdown:**
  Produce natural language explanations and formatted documentation.
  Consider using each of the additional content types to further enrich your markdown communications.
  For example, as "a picture speaks a thousands words", consider when you can better communicate a
  concept via a mermaid diagram and incorporate it into your markdown response.

- **Code Snippets:**
  Wrap code in triple backticks and specify the language for syntax highlighting.
  *Example:*
  ```python
  print('Hello, World!')
  ```

- **Mermaid Diagrams:**
  To render flowcharts or process maps, wrap your content in triple backticks with `mermaid` as the language.
  *Example:*
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A["Input"] --> B["Processing"];
      B --> C["Output"];
  ```

- **ABC Markdown (Music Scores):**
  Generate music scores by wrapping content in triple backticks with `abc` as the language.
  An inline player with a download link for the MIDI file will be provided.
  *Example:*
  ```abc
  C4 G4 A4 F4 E4 G4
  ```
