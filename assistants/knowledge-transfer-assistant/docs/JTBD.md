# Knowledge Transfer User Jobs and Outcomes

## 💰 Job 1: Offload Knowledge

“Get what's in my head (or docs) into other people.”
“Get what's in my head (or docs) into a system to share.”

### 🙋 Target User: Producer

Knowledge workers who use AI assistants to support complex cognitive tasks. This includes roles like product managers, researchers, technical leads, consultants, and operations strategists who frequently need to:

* Delegate operational or repetitive work
* Preserve or transfer internal knowledge

These users are technically literate and open to using AI, but often encounter friction, ambiguity, or lack of trust when doing so.

### Examples

* Brian fleshing out his ideas and gathering ideas and developing them.
* Sometimes it's important to know HOW someone else wants us to think about it.

### 🧭 Offload Knowledge Outcomes by Job Step

#### 1. Identify What to Offload

* Minimize time to determine which knowledge is valuable to preserve
* Maximize ability to identify redundant information that you don't need to offload again.
* Minimize effort to identify knowledge that is at risk of being lost. Users are rarely prompted or supported in recognizing what’s ephemeral, especially tacit or role-specific knowledge.
* Maximize clarity on what knowledge others will want or will need in the future. Predicting downstream needs is difficult without clear collaboration or communication loops.

#### 2. Extract Knowledge

* Maximize completeness of the captured knowledge. AI often captures surface-level information, missing nuance, assumptions, or rationale.
* Minimize risk of omitting tacit or hard-to-articulate information. Tacit knowledge is inherently hard to extract, especially if not prompted well. Tools don't scaffold reflection.
* Minimize effort required to capture contextual details. Context is scattered across tools, meetings, and tacit knowledge — it’s rarely captured systematically.
* Minimize time required to transfer knowledge from a person or doc.

#### 3. Structure and Store

* Maximize clarity of how preserved knowledge is organized.
* Maximize consistency in labeling or tagging knowledge.
* Minimize time to structure knowledge into a consistent and understandable format
* Maximize ability to associate related knowledge items

#### 4. Validate and Refine

* Maximize ability to identify gaps.
* Maximize ability to identify outdated information.
* Maximize confidence that preserved knowledge reflects current thinking.
* Minimize effort to review knowledge for accuracy and clarity
* Minimize effort to review the knowledge organization for accuracy and clarity (e.g., are the most important things captured in reasonable ways)

#### 5. Retrieve and Reuse

* Maximize trust that retrieved knowledge is accurate and complete
* Minimize duplication of effort due to inaccessible or unknown knowledge.
* Minimize time to locate relevant preserved knowledge
* Maximize ability to reuse preserved knowledge in different contexts

#### 6. Hand-off Knowledge

* Minimize friction in handing off knowledge to consumers.
* Maximize consumer adoption (they are busy, want a certain tone, etc.; they are often caught "off guard" with a message "out of the blue" asking them to spend time on some knowledge. The ask needs to be clear and give them assurance that they can accomplish it productively).

#### 7. Support knowledge consumers

* Minimize time spent supporting followup questions from consumers.
* Minimize time spent answering question repeatedly.

## 💰 Job 2: Learn Knowledge

“Go from unfamiliar to well-informed, without needing a human tutor.”
"Know what someone else knows."

### 🙋 Target User: Learner

Knowledge workers who use AI assistants to support complex cognitive tasks. This includes roles like product managers, researchers, technical leads, consultants, and operations strategists who frequently need to ramp up quickly in new domains.

These users are technically literate and open to using AI, but often encounter friction, ambiguity, or lack of trust when doing so.

### 🧭 Learn Knowledge Outcomes by Job Map Step

#### 1. Define the Scope

* Minimize time it takes to know where to start.
* Minimize time to identify the core topics within the subject.
* Minimize risk of including out-of-scope material
* Maximize clarity on the boundaries of the subject
* Minimize risk of missing prerequisite concepts
* Maximize relevancy to my own context. "What of this is worth using?"

#### 2. Find Learning Resources

* Minimize time to locate credible, comprehensive resources. "The people who have the information I need aren't available."
* Maximize coverage of essential topics across selected materials
* Minimize effort to organize resources for access and review
* Minimize risk of relying on low-quality or outdated information

#### 3. Build Understanding

* Minimize time to grasp each new concept
* Maximize ability to explain concepts in one’s own words
* Maximize clarity of relationships between subtopics
* Maximize retention of key ideas over time

#### 4. Validate Understanding

* Minimize time to detect gaps or misconceptions. “I’m not sure if I’ve learned enough or covered everything important.”
* Maximize accuracy of self-assessment. "Did I get get it all? Am I done?"
* Maximize ability to apply knowledge in practical contexts. "I think I get it... oh... nope."
* Minimize risk of forgetting critical information. “I forget what I learned before I get to use it.”

## 💰 Job 3: Explore a knowledge space

“Gain clarity and insights by exploring a defined knowledge space.”
"Understand what's in someone else's head."

### 🙋 Target User: Explorer

Knowledge workers who use AI assistants to support complex cognitive tasks. This includes roles like product managers, researchers, technical leads, consultants, and operations strategists who frequently need to explore large bodies of information with confidence.

These users are technically literate and open to using AI, but often encounter friction, ambiguity, or lack of trust when doing so.

### Examples of Explore Job

* With Cortex, people wanted the ideas from Brian to see how they would impact them

### 🧭 Outcomes by Job Map Step

#### 1. Define the knowledge area to explore

* Increase clarity on the boundaries of the topic
* Decrease ambiguity in scoping unfamiliar domains. “I’m unsure if I’m exploring the right domain or if my scope is too broad or narrow.”
* Increase confidence that the area aligns with the problem being solved. “It’s mentally taxing to judge whether content is actually relevant to my goals.”

#### 2. Identify sources and entry points

* Increase speed of locating credible, relevant sources
* Improve understanding of the structure of the knowledge corpus
* Decrease effort to evaluate trustworthiness of sources. “It takes too much time and effort to figure out which sources I can trust.”
* Increase discoverability of expert-recommended or AI-curated entry points. “It’s hard to know where to start or what path to follow.”
* Increase confidence that the sources reflect current thinking or trends

#### 3. Formulate exploration questions or goals

* Decrease time to generate meaningful questions. “It’s hard to know what questions to ask or how to phrase them meaningfully.”
* Increase clarity of what to ask or look for next.
* Improve ability to map questions to available information types
* Decrease mental load in articulating precise, actionable questions

#### 4. Assess relevance of information

* Decrease effort to filter out irrelevant material. “There’s too much low-value information—makes it hard to find insights.”
* Increase precision of information aligned with questions
* Increase recall of information aligned with questions
* Increase speed of determining whether a piece of information answers a question
* Decrease cognitive effort in resolving conflicting information. “I get conflicting answers and don’t know how to resolve or interpret them.”
* Improve consistency in how relevance is judged across sources

#### 5. Navigate or query the corpus

* Increase efficiency of traversing the material
* Decrease time spent retracing steps or revisiting already-covered ground
* Increase responsiveness of the AI to follow-up questions or pivots
* Improve transparency in how paths through the information are constructed. “The AI doesn’t make it clear why it’s showing certain information or how it's reasoning.”

#### 6. Supplement the corpus

* Decrease effort in getting extra-corpus info. "I don't see anything here about X, so I have to have a meeting with Brian."

#### 7. Capture discoveries and insights

* Improve ability to retain and retrieve key findings.  “I can’t easily remember or retrieve what I’ve already discovered.”
* Decrease effort required to synthesize takeaways into shareable form. “It’s hard to convert my findings into something I can share with others.”
* Increase support for connecting findings across different documents or contexts.
* Improve ability to separate raw data from insights or interpretations. “Even after reading, I struggle to summarize or synthesize key takeaways.”

#### 8. Adjust direction based on findings

* Decrease lag between learning something new and pivoting focus
* Increase ability to track why and when direction changed. “I lose track of how my thinking evolved or why I changed direction.”
* Decrease friction in iteratively refining exploration goals
* Improve visibility into emerging patterns or subtopics

#### 9. Conclude with a sense of completeness

* Increase confidence that key areas were explored. “I don’t know what’s missing or what I didn’t get to.” “There’s no signal to tell me whether I’ve covered what matters.”
* Increase clarity on what was *not* explored and why
* Decrease uncertainty about whether sufficient depth was achieved. “I’m not confident that I’ve covered the important areas or reached sufficient depth.”
* Improve ability to summarize progress and open questions for handoff or future work
