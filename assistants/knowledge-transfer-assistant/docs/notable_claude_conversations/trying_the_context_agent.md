reason: Ok, please craft me up a new message I can share out to others based upon the original recipe-executor_codebase-generator_cortex-platform_early-explorer-notes.md I attached. Make it a little easier to consume, while a) introducing them to the 3 projects (many have not heard of any of them, include links), b) capturing some of the more wild things shared (like the fact that the recipe-executor code is actually auto-generated from the docs/spec files via recipes and we iterate on the code through that, or that the entire cortex-core was built from a 1-page "plan" + vision doc, etc.) and c) also being very clear about the very early nature of this (we're literally mid-stream on all 3 at once, just enough to prove them out and now on to improving each one-by-one, making them more complete and accessible), and then include our share link.
```
