- Let's keep working on the project-assistant project (assistants/project-assistant). Please reread the notes in docs/DESIGN.md for the big picture. Also, as we work on code, please respect the docs/DEV_GUIDE.md and check out some notes on relevant libraries at docs/ASSISTANT_LIBRARY_NOTES.md, and docs/WORKBENCH_NOTES.md. Let me know when you've brushed up on all that and I'll let you know what we're working on next.
- Feel free to look for examples in other assistants we've been developing in the assistants directory. assistants/codespace-assistant is more up-to-date than the rest.
- I would like your help in creating what I call a "Plan of Action". This is different than a normal planning document in that it is a set of instructions that, if followed by a software developer, would result in the plan's objectives being met. A POA is created by investigating relevant code including the current project source as well as library code that is being imported and third-party code when necessary. This investigation needs to occur because each POA step should be very specific, such as "delete <some file>" or "use <function in library> to implement <method>" or "create new module that operates over <library y> methods". POAs will be reviewed by senior developers, and you can expect that they will call you out if you are not using existing library methods to do things or have an overly-complicated or too-simple plan. For this reason, make sure that your plan is well researched and well reasoned. Let's start a POA in docs/POA.md for this: Instead of using /start and /join commands to link conversations, we want to look into using the cloning approach to create a new conversation seeded/configured for the recipient users and then create copy/read-only share links that your assistant could provide back (or put into your inspector) to give to the other users - then they would just follow those share links using the normal redemption approach we use for all shares, which would create a copy of that newly created conversation for each user, and those could be associated with the group (whatever term was landed on for that) but since they are not the originator, they'd all be in whatever mode /join puts them in. Current cloning code includes conversations and other things we don't need for a new connected conversation, so we don't want to use it directly, instead, find what parts you wanted - which is likely mostly creating the conversation, the assistant/config, and a welcome message. For this plan, you should be familiar with _at least_ the workbench service controller methods (API) that can be found at /home/payne/repos/semanticworkbench/workbench-service/semantic_workbench_service/controller, and the clients that work with this API that you have access to that can be found at /home/payne/repos/semanticworkbench/libraries/python/semantic-workbench-api-model/semantic_workbench_api_model and our assistant base class that is found at /home/payne/repos/semanticworkbench/libraries/python/semantic-workbench-assistant/semantic_workbench_assistant.
- are you aware we can get a ConversationAPIClient from the ConversationContext of the current conversation (available in all chat event handlers). See:
  /home/payne/repos/semanticworkbench/libraries/python/semantic-workbench-assistant/semantic_workbench_assistant/assistant_app/context.py
- Excellent. Now, let's work on copy. Note, we want to have different copy in some places depending on whether the assistant is using the "context transfer" config template, or the "default" (project) config template, so any time
â”‚   we have a copy difference between the two templates, the copy should be located in config.py.
- Let's keep working on the project-assistant project (assistants/project-assistant). Please reread the notes in docs/DESIGN.md for the big picture. Also, as we work on code, please respect the docs/DEV_GUIDE.md and check out some notes on relevant libraries at docs/ASSISTANT_LIBRARY_NOTES.md, and docs/WORKBENCH_NOTES.md. I have recorded our most recent work in docs/WORKING.md. Once you have read all those, let me know and I'll tell you what we're working on now.
- You have access to logs in .data/logs. We're trying to fix the missing welcome message after a share link is redeemed. You can see what code we've changed using git recently to add more logging. Check out the code and logs and help me figure out why welcome messages aren't getting added on shared team conversations.
