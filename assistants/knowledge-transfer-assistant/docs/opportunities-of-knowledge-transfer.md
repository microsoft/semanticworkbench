# Knowledge Transfer Opportunities for Microsoft Research

## Research Project Onboarding

Scenario: A principal researcher leading a multi-year ML project needs to onboard new team members, visiting researchers, and collaborators throughout the project lifecycle.

Knowledge Transfer Setup:
- Knowledge Brief: Project overview, research questions, current hypotheses, and timeline
- Learning Objectives: Understanding the codebase, reproducing baseline results, contributing to specific research directions
- Relevant Files: Codebase documentation, experimental logs, literature review summaries, dataset documentation

Getting Started:
1. Create coordinator conversation: "Help me structure onboarding materials for our neural architecture search project"
2. Upload key documents: paper drafts, experiment tracking sheets, codebase README files
3. Define learning objectives: "New team members should be able to run our baseline experiments and understand our current research directions"

## Cross-Team Research Methodology Transfer

Scenario: A research team has developed novel evaluation methodologies or experimental frameworks that other teams want to adopt.

Knowledge Transfer Setup:
- Knowledge Brief: Methodology overview, when to use it, expected outcomes
- Learning Objectives: Implementing the methodology, interpreting results, avoiding common pitfalls
- Relevant Files: Evaluation scripts, example datasets, results interpretation guides

Getting Started:
1. Create coordinator conversation: "I need to share our evaluation methodology with three other research teams"
2. Upload methodology documents: evaluation protocols, example analyses, troubleshooting guides
3. Set learning outcomes: "Teams should successfully implement our evaluation pipeline and interpret results correctly"

## Publication Knowledge Synthesis

Scenario: Research group preparing major conference submissions needs to synthesize findings across multiple related projects and ensure all contributors understand the unified narrative.

Knowledge Transfer Setup:
- Knowledge Brief: Paper scope, key contributions, submission timeline
- Learning Objectives: Understanding cross-project connections, contributing to specific paper sections, preparing for reviewer questions
- Relevant Files: Draft manuscripts, experimental results, related work surveys

Getting Started:
1. Create coordinator conversation: "Help me organize our findings from three related projects into a coherent ICML submission"
2. Upload project materials: individual project summaries, experimental data, previous paper drafts
3. Define contributions: "Each author should understand how their work fits into the broader narrative and be prepared to defend specific claims"
