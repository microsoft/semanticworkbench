# Knowledge Transfer Assistant Implementation Design

## Overview

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant is designed as a dual-role context transfer system that facilitates knowledge sharing between different conversations in the Semantic Workbench. It provides a structured way for Coordinators to organize and share complex information with Team members, featuring bidirectional communication, automatic knowledge synthesis, and real-time collaboration.

## System Design

### Core Architecture

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant operates as a single unified system focused on knowledge transfer and information sharing. It serves as a mediator assistant that helps bridge knowledge gaps between coordinators who possess information and team members who need access to that information.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Service Name**: Knowledge Transfer Assistant
- **Service ID**: `knowledge-transfer-assistant.made-exploration`
- **Primary Focus**: File-sharing mediation and collaborative knowledge sharing
- **Architecture**: Dual-role system with coordinator and team member modes

### Conversation Structure

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant manages three distinct types of conversations:

1. **Coordinator Conversation**:
   - Created when a user first interacts with the Knowledge Transfer Assistant
   - Acts as the personal workspace for the knowledge organizer/coordinator
   - Contains private communication between the coordinator and the assistant
   - Stores the link to the shareable team conversation
   - Used for knowledge organization, structuring, and planning
   - Maintains an auto-updating whiteboard based on conversation content

2. **Shareable Team Conversation**:
   - Automatically created when a coordinator establishes a knowledge transfer project
   - Never directly used by any user - serves as a template only
   - Has a share URL associated with it for team access
   - When team members click the share link, they get a copy of this conversation
   - Contains project-specific setup and metadata
   - Pre-configured with team member role and access to shared knowledge

3. **Team Conversation(s)**:
   - Created when a team member redeems the share URL
   - Each team member gets their own personal conversation
   - All team conversations are linked to the same knowledge transfer project
   - Used for team members to explore knowledge, ask questions, and request information
   - Automatically set up with team member role and access to shared artifacts

### Conversation Roles

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant supports two distinct conversation roles:

1. **Coordinator Role**:
   - **Knowledge Organization**: Collection and structuring of complex information for sharing
   - **Automatic Whiteboard Management**: System maintains an auto-updating knowledge repository
   - **Information Request Resolution**: Responds to specific information needs from team members
   - **File and Context Sharing**: Uploads and organizes relevant documents and resources
   - **Project Brief Creation**: Establishes goals, context, and success criteria for knowledge transfer
   - **Access to Full Context**: Can see all team member requests and interactions

2. **Team Member Role**:
   - **Knowledge Exploration**: Interactive access to structured knowledge base and whiteboard
   - **Information Request Creation**: Can request specific information or clarification from coordinators
   - **File Synchronization**: Access to shared files and documents from coordinators
   - **Progress Tracking**: Can update status and mark success criteria as completed
   - **Coordinator Context Access**: Can view recent coordinator conversations for additional context
   - **Collaborative Discovery**: Can explore knowledge at their own pace and depth

The system supports an iterative and asynchronous workflow where team member exploration and coordinator guidance can occur concurrently with automatic synchronization of knowledge and updates.

### Key Architectural Features

## Storage Architecture

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant leverages the Semantic Workbench Assistant library's storage capabilities with a file-based architecture designed for reliability and simplicity:

### Directory Structure

```text
projects/
├── project_id_1/
│   ├── linked_conversations/         # Directory tracking all linked conversations
│   │   ├── conversation_id_1         # Empty file - presence indicates linkage
│   │   ├── conversation_id_2         # Empty file for another linked conversation
│   │   └── ...                       # One file per linked conversation
│   ├── requests/                     # Information requests directory
│   │   ├── request_id_1.json         # Individual request files with UUID names
│   │   └── request_id_2.json         # Each request stored independently
│   ├── project.json                  # Core project information and metadata
│   ├── brief.json                    # Knowledge transfer brief and goals
│   ├── whiteboard.json               # Automatically updated knowledge content
│   ├── log.json                      # Chronological event log
│   └── coordinator_conversation.json # Recent coordinator messages for team access
└── project_id_2/
    └── ...
```

### Conversation-Specific Storage

Additionally, conversation-specific data is stored in the assistant library's context-specific storage:

```text
.data/assistants/{assistant_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}/
├── project_role.json         # Role of this conversation (coordinator or team)
└── project_association.json  # Project this conversation is associated with
```
