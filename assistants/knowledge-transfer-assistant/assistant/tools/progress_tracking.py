        Report that the knowledge transfer is complete, concluding the transfer lifecycle.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - When all learning outcomes for all objectives have been marked as achieved
        - When the user confirms the knowledge has been successfully learned
        - When the learning objectives have been fully achieved
        - When it's time to formally conclude the knowledge transfer

        This is a significant milestone that indicates the knowledge transfer has successfully achieved all its learning objectives. Before using this tool, verify that all learning outcomes have been marked as achieved.
