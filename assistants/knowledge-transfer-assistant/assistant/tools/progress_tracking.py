        Mark a learning outcome as achieved for tracking knowledge transfer progress.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - When the user reports completing a specific learning task or deliverable
        - When evidence has been provided that a learning outcome has been met
        - When a milestone for one of the learning objectives has been achieved
        - When tracking progress and updating the transfer status

        Each completed outcome moves the knowledge transfer closer to completion. When all outcomes are achieved, the transfer can be marked as complete.

            objective_id: The UUID of the learning objective
            outcome_id: The UUID of the learning outcome within the objective
