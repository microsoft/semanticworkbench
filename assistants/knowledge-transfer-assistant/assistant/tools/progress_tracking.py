        Mark a learning outcome as achieved for tracking knowledge transfer progress.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - When the user reports completing a specific learning task or deliverable
        - When evidence has been provided that a learning outcome has been met
        - When a milestone for one of the learning objectives has been achieved
        - When tracking progress and updating the transfer status

        Each completed outcome moves the knowledge transfer closer to completion. When all outcomes
