        Mark a learning outcome as achieved for tracking knowledge transfer progress.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - When the user reports completing a specific learning task or deliverable
        - When evidence has been provided that a learning outcome has been met
        - When a milestone for one of the learning objectives has been achieved
        - When tracking progress and updating the transfer status

        Each completed outcome moves the knowledge transfer closer to completion. When all outcomes
        are achieved, the transfer can be marked as complete.

        IMPORTANT: Always use get_share_info() first to see the current objectives, outcomes, and their indices
        before marking anything as complete.

        Args:
            objective_index: The index of the objective (0-based integer) from get_share_info() output
            criterion_index: The index of the outcome within the objective (0-based integer)
