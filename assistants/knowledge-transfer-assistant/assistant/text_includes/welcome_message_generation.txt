- Provide a top-level summary of what this shared knowledge is about (in a single sentence, a larger summary is included in the side panel)
- If there are learning objectives and outcomes in this knowledge share, provide a top-level summary of them (in a single sentence, they can read more details in the side panel).
- Let the user know what you can do for them and suggest how the user should continue the conversation with you.
- Your output format should be markdown. Do NOT include any other commentary. Do NOT include backticks. Do NOT surround it with quotes.
