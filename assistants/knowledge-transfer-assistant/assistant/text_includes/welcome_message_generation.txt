# Welcome!

This is your personal conversation for gaining deeper understanding of the knowledge shared to you! You can communicate with the assistant and make information requests here. See more information about your shared knowledge in the side panel. <and then include a brief overview of the shared knowledge>
```

Your output format should be markdown. Do NOT include any other commentary. Do NOT include backticks. Do NOT surround it with quotes.
