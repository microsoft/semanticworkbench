# Mission Assistant: Plan of Action

## Project Overview

The Mission Assistant is designed to facilitate file sharing and communication between different conversations in Semantic Workbench. It allows creating "missions" where users can invite others to join, share files, and synchronize content between conversations.

## Current Status

- Initial implementation completed with core functionality
- Key components implemented:
  - Mission state management
  - File synchronization between linked conversations
  - Invitation system for joining missions
  - Cross-conversation communication mechanisms
- Code compiles but may need refinements before fully working

## Recent Changes

- Moved design documents into a dedicated docs folder
- Modified mission.py to implement core functionality
- Updated test_artifact_loading.py

## Action Items

1. Create new storage management module (`mission_storage.py`)
   - Implement functions to create/access mission directory structure
   - Add utilities for working with shared artifact storage
   - Provide path resolution for mission/conversation/artifact paths

2. Define mission artifact data models (`artifacts.py`)
   - Update existing models to align with new storage structure
   - Create Pydantic models for Mission, MissionBriefing, KnowledgeBase, etc.
   - Add serialization/deserialization methods

3. Refactor mission state management (`mission.py`)
   - Replace current file synchronization with shared artifact storage
   - Update MissionStateManager to use new storage structure
   - Modify functions to read/write to appropriate directories

4. Implement HQ conversation handler (`hq_mode.py`)
   - Create specialized handler for HQ-specific operations
   - Add methods for creating/managing mission briefings
   - Add KB management functionality

5. Implement Field conversation handler (`field_mode.py`)
   - Create specialized handler for Field-specific operations
   - Add request logging capabilities
   - Implement progress reporting functionality

6. Update invitation system
   - Modify to store invitation data in mission structure
   - Update redemption process to register conversations in mission structure
   - Add role assignment (HQ/Field) during mission setup

7. Create mission command processor (`command_processor.py`)
   - Implement handlers for mission-specific commands
   - Add role-based command authorization
   - Create help documentation for commands

8. Implement mission status updates
   - Add status tracking for mission progress
   - Create methods to update/query mission status
   - Add notification system for status changes

9. Update tests
   - Create unit tests for new storage structure
   - Add tests for HQ/Field mode functionality
   - Update existing tests to use new architecture

10. Documentation
    - Update README with mission assistant usage instructions
    - Document command syntax and examples
    - Add architecture diagrams
