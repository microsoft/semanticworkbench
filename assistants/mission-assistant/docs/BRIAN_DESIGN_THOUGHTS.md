Certainly, here’s what was discussed about implementation ideas, particularly in relation to the **Semantic Workbench** and assistants:

---

### **1. Current Semantic Workbench Capabilities**

Brian referenced how the existing Semantic Workbench assistant operates with **single conversations**, but each session already allows for:

- **File Shares (Attachments):** Files can be shared and referenced in the conversation.
- **Content Snapshots:** At any point, a conversation can be copied to fork a distinct instance with shared context at the time of copy.
- **Multi-Participant Shared Sessions:** This feature supports invites for both read-only observers and collaborative participants.

---

### **2. Applying These Capabilities**

For the **dual-mode assistant** concept, these capabilities could provide a foundation for creating separate Sender and Recipient workflows:

- **Dual Conversations Design:** Use the current system’s ability to fork conversations to create distinct Sender and Recipient threads:
  - The Sender conversation remains the source of truth for gathering Raw Context and refining it.
  - The Recipient conversation would reference shared context from that source (e.g., using conversation snapshots or version tracking to manage consistency).
- **Shared Artifacts and Context Flow:** Files, Refined Context summaries, blockers, and updates could be “bookmarked” or flagged in the Sender session, ensuring they seamlessly transfer to the Recipient session.

---

### **3. Information Radiator Integration**

Brian also emphasized integrating **side-panel content** as a powerful way to dynamically share state across sessions. For example:

- **Intent Tracker:** Always visible in both Sender and Recipient panels to ensure alignment.  
- **Blocker Queue Sync:** Updates made in the Recipient conversation (e.g., unresolved questions) could automatically appear in the Sender’s list of priorities, ensuring asynchronous workflows across sessions without manual syncing.
- **Curated Context View:** Both Sender and Recipient participants could see a streamlined version of the refined context in their side-panel as a “quick reference.”

---

### **4. Balancing Rigid Structure with Flexibility**

Brian suggested drawing inspiration from an OpenAI use-case:

- A feature where the assistant prompts a single round of clarification questions before completing a task.
- While useful, this approach could feel rigid if participants prefer more iterative engagement.
This inspired discussions around designing workflows where clarifications are optional or user-controlled rather than mandatory.

---

### **5. MVP Scope vs. Future Opportunities**

For the MVP:

- Focus on enabling basic **dual conversations** with shared context and state (e.g., Raw Context and Refined Context flow).
- Allow blocking questions to auto-log for the Sender session without requiring manual transfer.
- Explore using the **Skills Framework** to modularize Sender and Recipient routines (e.g., a "Log Blocker" skill embedded in Recipient workflows).

For future iterations:

- Expand side-panel views to include richer representations of context, such as “working versions” or natural-language “diffs” between Sender/Recipient perspectives.

Would you like me to organize these implementation ideas further or suggest specific workflows for starting points?
