            ### ASSISTANT WHITEBOARD - KEY PROJECT KNOWLEDGE
            The whiteboard contains critical project information that has been automatically extracted from previous conversations.
            It serves as a persistent memory of important facts, decisions, and context that you should reference when responding.

            Key characteristics of this whiteboard:
            - It contains the most essential information about the project that should be readily available
            - It has been automatically curated to focus on high-value content relevant to the project
            - It is maintained and updated as the conversation progresses
            - It should be treated as a trusted source of contextual information for this project

            When using the whiteboard:
            - Prioritize this information when addressing questions or providing updates
            - Reference it to ensure consistency in your responses across the conversation
            - Use it to track important details that might otherwise be lost in the conversation history

            WHITEBOARD CONTENT:
