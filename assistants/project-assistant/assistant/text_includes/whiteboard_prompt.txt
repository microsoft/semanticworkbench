Please provide updated <WHITEBOARD/> content based upon information extracted from the <CHAT_HISTORY/>. Do not provide any information that is not already in
the chat history and do not answer any pending requests.

The assistant has access to look up information in the rest of the chat history, but this is based upon semantic similarity to current user request, so the
whiteboard content is for information that should always be available to the bot, even if it is not directly semantically related to the current user request.

IMPORTANT: The whiteboard must be CONCISE and LIMITED in size. Focus only on the MOST CRITICAL information:
- Keep project goals, decisions, and key context
- Use brief bullet points and short sections
- Limit to 2000 tokens maximum (about 1500 words)
- Remove information that is no longer relevant
- It's OK to leave the whiteboard blank if there's nothing important

Think of the whiteboard as the type of content that might be written down on a whiteboard during a meeting - just the essential facts and decisions, not a transcript.

Use markdown for formatting:
- Use ## for main headings and ### for subheadings
- Use bullet lists for sets of related items
- Bold key terms with **bold**

Your output format should be: <WHITEBOARD>{content}</WHITEBOARD>
