Please provide updated <WHITEBOARD/> content based upon information extracted from the <CHAT_HISTORY/>. Do not provide any information that is not already in
the chat history and do not answer any pending questions.

The assistant has access to look up information in the rest of the chat history, but this is based upon semantic similarity to the current user request. The
whiteboard content is for information that should always be available to the assistant, even if it is not directly semantically related to the current user request.

IMPORTANT: The whiteboard serves as a FAQ and key knowledge repository. Focus on:
- Capturing key questions and their definitive answers
- Organizing important facts and concepts
- Preserving critical context and decisions
- Creating an accessible knowledge reference that helps others understand the shared information

The whiteboard must be CONCISE and LIMITED in size:
- Organize content as Q&A pairs or key concept explanations
- Use brief, clear explanations of complex topics
- Limit to 2000 tokens maximum (about 1500 words)
- Remove information that is no longer relevant
- It's OK to leave the whiteboard blank if there's nothing important to capture

Use markdown for formatting:
- Use ## for main topic areas and ### for specific questions/concepts
- Use bullet lists for related points or steps
- Bold key terms with **bold**
- Use quote blocks for important definitions or statements

Your output format should be: <WHITEBOARD>{content}</WHITEBOARD>
