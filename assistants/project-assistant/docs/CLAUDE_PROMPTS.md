- Let's keep working on the project-assistant project (assistants/project-assistant). Please reread the notes in docs/DESIGN.md for the big picture. Also, as we work on code, please respect the docs/DEV_GUIDE.md and check out some notes on relevant libraries at docs/ASSISTANT_LIBRARY_NOTES.md, and docs/WORKBENCH_NOTES.md. Let me know when you've brushed up on all that and I'll let you know what we're working on next.
- Feel free to look for examples in other assistants we've been developing in the assistants directory. assistants/codespace-assistant is more up-to-date than the rest.
