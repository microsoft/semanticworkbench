# Knowledge Transfer

## Clear separation of state

- Conversation state: messages and attachments
- Knowledge Base meta for the assistant to guide the producer conversation
  - Audience
  - takeaways
  - Objectives and outcomes
  - Gaps
- Knowledge Base
  - Digest
  - Brief
  - Files
  - Facts

## Producer assistance

- Active listening
- Stage aware (audience, takeaways, kb prep, objectives/outcomes, brief, share msg)
- Use multi-agent feedback (ultra-think, panel of experts); especially on kb prep
- Produces KB
  - Use grounding eval against all generated docs.
  - Make kb docs visible for user modification.

## Semantics vs Style

### Semantics Approaches

## Knowledge Base Approaches

## Producer Assistance



## Learning Styles

Maintaining preferences of the learner, such as:

- visual or concrete examples
- pacing
- academic or plain-speaking
- open exploration or guided (preferred learning modes)

## Learning Modes

### Explorer

The knowledge base is explored by the consumer asking the assistant to help in whichever way the consumer would like.

### Self-guided Curriculum

Learning objectives and outcomes are set by the producer. The progression is suggested, but the learner can go in any order. The system tracks when outcomes have been achieved.

### Interviewee

The producer/assistant creates a list of concepts or topics that the user will be taken through, progressing through Bloom's Taxonomy for each.

## Issues

Fluff

Style.

How is this better than one long doc?

## Other things to try

- Using Bloom's taxonomy to instruct the assistant for what it should do on the next turn.
- Scoring the user's taxonomy level on a given topic.
- Breaking larger corpus into lists of topics.
- Engaged/Frustrated/Confused detection.
- Engaged/Frustrated response adaptation.
- Learning style adaptation (concrete examples vs visual diagrams)
- Learner pace preference adaptation (faster/slower)
- Topic prerequisite detection (detecting which topics should be covered first)
- Response pattern rotation

 ## Related Research

 You’ve hit on a fundamental issue! The pre-AI-winter symbolic AI folks absolutely did make this distinction - they saw content/information as separable from its presentation/style. This shows up in several key areas of literature:

Classical AI/Knowledge Representation:

- Minsky’s Frames (1974) - attempted to separate semantic content from surface realization
- Schank’s Conceptual Dependency Theory - tried to represent meaning independent of linguistic form
- Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) - explicitly designed to separate logical content from syntactic presentation

Linguistics/Philosophy:

- Frege’s sense/reference distinction - the foundational idea that meaning exists apart from expression
- Chomsky’s deep structure vs. surface structure - competence vs. performance
- Grice’s work on implicature - what’s said vs. what’s meant

Modern tensions:

The “distributional hypothesis” that underlies modern NLP (“you shall know a word by the company it keeps”) fundamentally entangles meaning with usage patterns. Some relevant recent work:

- “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners” (GPT-3 paper) shows style and content are learned together
- Work on disentangled representations (like style transfer research) tries to separate these again
- Prompt engineering literature increasingly recognizes that HOW you ask affects WHAT you get

The irony is that the old symbolic approaches failed partly because they couldn’t handle the messiness of natural language, while modern approaches succeed by embracing that messiness - but lose the clean content/style separation in the process.

The knowledge representation vs. connectionist debate has some fascinating historical documents.

“Toward Controlled Generation of Text” by Hu et al. (ICML 2017) is a singular representative study that directly addresses the content/style disentanglement issue in neural language models.

This paper is particularly relevant because it:

1. Explicitly tackles disentanglement: The paper aims at generating plausible text sentences whose attributes are controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics
1. Separates content from style: The model augments unstructured variables z with a set of structured variables c each of which targets a salient and independent semantic feature of sentences
1. Addresses the core problem: The authors note that varying individual code may result in unexpected variation of other unspecified attributes besides the desired one - exactly the entanglement problem you’re describing
1. Introduces explicit independence constraints: To ensure true disentanglement, they introduce the independency constraint which separates these attributes with c by enforcing them to be fully captured by the unstructured part z

The paper demonstrates this separation empirically - when they control for sentiment (a “style” attribute), other aspects like subject matter and tone (the “content”) remain unchanged when their independence constraint is active. Without it, changing the style inadvertently changes the content as well.

This work bridges the gap between the symbolic AI tradition (which had clean content/style separation but couldn’t handle natural language well) and modern neural approaches (which handle language well but entangle everything together). It’s a foundational paper in the area of controllable text generation that directly addresses your concern about the lack of distinction between information and style in LLMs.
