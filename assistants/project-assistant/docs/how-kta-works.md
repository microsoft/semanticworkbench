# Understanding how the Knowledge Transfer Assistant

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant isn't simply a chat conversation with an assistant.

It uses a "more code than model", recipe-inspired approach that runs "meta-cognitive operations" to create an assistant that guides users through the knowledge transfer process.

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant is an assistant experience that runs within _MADE: Exploration's_ Semantic Workbench.

## How it works

The Knowledge Transfer Assistant uses a multi-conversation architecture to separate knowledge creation from knowledge consumption, addressing the confusion that arises when multiple participants work in the same shared conversation.

### Dual-Conversation Architecture

The system operates through two conversation types:

1. **Coordinator Conversation**: Where knowledge creators collaborate to structure and package their knowledge
2. **Team Conversations**: Individual conversations created for each team member who joins the knowledge transfer

### Knowledge Artifacts

The system structures informal knowledge into four transferable artifacts:

- **Knowledge Brief**: Context, scope, and timeline summary
- **Knowledge Digest**: An organized outline of all knowledge from coordinator conversations and attachments, automatically updated by LLM analysis. Contains high information density with key concepts, decisions, facts, and contextâ€”serving as the primary knowledge reference for team members
- **Learning Objectives**: Structured goals with measurable outcomes
- **Information Requests**: Bidirectional Q&A channel with priority levels

### Cross-Conversation Communication

Isolated conversations communicate through centralized components:

- **Share Storage**: Maintains knowledge packages and progress across conversations
- **Share Manager**: Creates shareable team conversations via secure URLs
- **Notifications System**: Enables updates between coordinators and team members
- **File Synchronization**: Propagates documents across relevant conversations

### User Experience

**Coordinators:**
- Navigate to https://semantic-workbench.azurewebsites.net/ and start a new conversation with the Knowledge Transfer Assistant.
- The assistant will guide you through:
    - Define learning objectives
    - Develop content through natural conversation and file attachments
    - Create a knowledge brief and invitation messages for your team members
    - Share the provided Share Link with your team members.
- Monitor team progress via real-time dashboards and notifications
- Respond to information requests

**Team Members:**
- Join a new conversation via the coordinator-provided share URL, creating individual conversation
- Receive personalized welcome and knowledge brief
- Work through objectives with assistant guidance
- Access synchronized files and updated digest
- Submit questions through information requests

### Technical Implementation

The system uses orchestration logic to coordinate multiple AI assistants rather than relying on a single large model. This enables role-specific assistant behavior, persistent state across conversation boundaries, and real-time synchronization between coordinator and team conversations.

The architecture allows multiple team members to join knowledge transfers independently while maintaining separation between knowledge creation and consumption workflows.
