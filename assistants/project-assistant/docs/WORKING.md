## âœ… COMPLETED: Whiteboard Implementation

I've replaced the knowledge base "project_kb" with a whiteboard that gets automatically updated as the coordinator assembles their project. The implementation follows the plan below:

1. **Model Modifications**:
   - Updated the `ProjectKB` model in project_data.py to use a single content field instead of sections
   - Simplified the model by removing complex section handling while maintaining backwards compatibility

2. **Auto-Update Mechanism**:
   - Added `auto_update_whiteboard` method in project_manager.py that analyzes chat history with the LLM
   - Implemented the whiteboard prompt logic using the provided template
   - Created extraction logic to parse the LLM's whiteboard content

3. **Conversation Integration**:
   - Modified chat.py to call the whiteboard update method after each assistant message
   - The whiteboard now automatically updates after each assistant message to capture key information

4. **Command Modifications**:
   - Repurposed the /add-kb-section command to add content to the whiteboard
   - Maintained the ability for both automatic and manual whiteboard updates

This implementation successfully creates a dynamic whiteboard that evolves throughout the conversation, capturing important project context without requiring manual updates. The whiteboard content is generated by analyzing the conversation history using the provided prompt.

## Next Tasks

Additional tasks from the original list:

1. Modify the UI to show the project ID and invite code in more places for easy visibility
2. Update commands to improve their usability and make them more discoverable
3. Add more examples and documentation for both Coordinator and Team modes
