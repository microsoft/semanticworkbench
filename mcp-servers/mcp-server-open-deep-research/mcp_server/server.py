        A specialized team member that thoroughly researches the internet to answer your questions.
        Use them for anything requiring web browsing—provide as much context as possible, especially
        if you need to research a specific timeframe. Don’t hesitate to give complex tasks, like
        analyzing differences between products or spotting discrepancies between sources. Your
        request must be full sentences, not just search terms (e.g., “Research current trends for…”
        instead of a few keywords). For context, pass as much background as you can: if using this
        tool in a conversation, include the conversation history; if in a broader context, include
        any relevant documents or details. If there is no context, pass “None.” Finally, for the
        request itself, provide the specific question you want answered, with as much detail as
        possible about what you need and the desired output.
