# Open Deep Research MCP Server

This is a [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) server that wraps the [HuggingFace Open Deep Research](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/tree/main/examples/open_deep_research) project, built on their [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) library, making the project available for use with MCP clients, such as AI assistants.
