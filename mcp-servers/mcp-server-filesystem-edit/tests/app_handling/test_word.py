### Overview
Fluent UI, developed by Microsoft, embodies the design language of Microsoft 365 and emphasizes \
accessibility and consistent user experiences. When merged with Tailwind CSS—a utility-first, highly \
flexible styling framework—this approach allows for rapid style customization and a tailored \
layout that meets both brand standards and modern design expectations.

This combination not only enhances user experience but also ensures that applications are visually appealing and functional.
