# SamplingFnT Type Error Fix

## Problem

When using the MCP client session in our assistant extensions, we encountered the following error:

```
Exception has occurred: ImportError
cannot import name 'SamplingFnT' from 'mcp.client.session' (/workspaces/semanticworkbench/assistants/codespace-assistant/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mcp/client/session.py)
```

This issue occurs because the type signature of `SamplingFnT` in the MCP client session has changed between versions. Specifically:

1. Our codebase expects `SamplingFnT` to accept multiple type parameters
2. The installed version of the MCP package only defines `SamplingFnT` to accept a single type parameter

This mismatch causes type errors when running the assistant.

## Solution

To fix this issue, we've modified our use of `SamplingFnT` to be more flexible and compatible with different versions of the MCP package. The solution involves:

1. Using Python's **ellipsis syntax (`...`)** in the type annotation to make the type parameter more flexible
2. Changing:
   ```python
   MCPSamplingMessageHandler = SamplingFnT
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   MCPSamplingMessageHandler = SamplingFnT[...]
   ```

This change tells the type checker to accept any number of type parameters for `SamplingFnT`, making our code compatible with both the older and newer versions of the MCP package.

## Implementation Details

The fix is implemented in the following files:

- `libraries/python/assistant-extensions/assistant_extensions/mcp/_model.py`
- `libraries/python/assistant-extensions/assistant_extensions/mcp/_server_utils.py`

We've ensured that the changes are backward compatible and won't break existing functionality.

## Additional CI Improvements

We've also improved CI reliability by adding the `--isolated` flag to UV commands in the `python.mk` makefile. This prevents locking conflicts when multiple parallel CI processes attempt to access the same lock files simultaneously.

The `--isolated` flag ensures each process operates independently without sharing lock files, eliminating race conditions in the CI environment and making builds more reliable.

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Run the assistant with `python -m assistant.chat`
2. Verify that no import errors occur related to `SamplingFnT`
3. Confirm the assistant can initialize properly and respond to user messages

## Future Considerations

For future development, we should consider:

1. Adding version checking to dynamically adapt to different versions of the MCP package
2. Creating a more robust type compatibility layer if needed
3. Monitoring for additional type changes in dependencies that might require similar fixes
