# SamplingFnT Type Error Fix

This document explains the issue with the `SamplingFnT` class in the MCP client session and how it was fixed.

## The Issue

The VSCode MCP server dynamic URL feature was failing with the following error:

```
Exception has occurred: ImportError
cannot import name 'SamplingFnT' from 'mcp.client.session' (/workspaces/semanticworkbench/assistants/codespace-assistant/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mcp/client/session.py)
```

This error occurred because the `SamplingFnT` class in the `mcp.client.session` module was using `RequestContext` with two type parameters:

```python
class SamplingFnT(Protocol):
    async def __call__(
        self,
        context: RequestContext["ClientSession", Any],
        params: types.CreateMessageRequestParams,
    ) -> types.CreateMessageResult | types.ErrorData: ...
```

However, the installed version of `RequestContext` in the `.venv` directory only accepted one type parameter.

## The Fix

The issue was fixed by modifying the `MCPSamplingMessageHandler` type in the `_model.py` file to use a more flexible approach with the ellipsis (`...`) syntax for parameters:

```python
# Before
MCPSamplingMessageHandler = Callable[
    [RequestContext[ClientSession], CreateMessageRequestParams],
    Awaitable[Union[CreateMessageResult, ErrorData]]
]

# After
MCPSamplingMessageHandler = Callable[
    ...,
    Awaitable[Union[CreateMessageResult, ErrorData]]
]
```

This change allows the `MCPSamplingMessageHandler` type to accept any number of parameters, which makes it compatible with both versions of the `RequestContext` class.

Additionally, the following changes were made:

1. Updated related files to use this new approach:
   - `_openai_utils.py`
   - `_sampling_handler.py`
   - `_server_utils.py`

2. Removed explicit type annotations in handler methods:
   ```python
   # Before
   async def handle_message(
       self,
       context: ClientSessionContext,
       params: CreateMessageRequestParams,
   ) -> CreateMessageResult | ErrorData:
   
   # After
   async def handle_message(
       self,
       context,
       params: CreateMessageRequestParams,
   ) -> CreateMessageResult | ErrorData:
   ```

## Testing

The fix was tested by:

1. Running the assistant with `python -m assistant.chat`
2. Checking if the server is running on port 3000 with `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Testing the VSCode MCP server with `node /workspaces/semanticworkbench/scripts/test-vscode-mcp.js`
4. Checking if the VSCode MCP server is accessible with `curl -I http://localhost:6010/sse`

All tests were successful, indicating that the fix resolved the issue.

## Impact

This fix ensures that the VSCode MCP server dynamic URL feature works correctly without type errors. The feature allows the semantic workbench to dynamically pull the VSCode MCP server URL from the VSCode output, ensuring that it always uses the correct URL even if the port changes.
