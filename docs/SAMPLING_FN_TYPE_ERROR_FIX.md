# SamplingFnT Type Error Fix

## Overview

This document explains the issue with the `SamplingFnT` type in the MCP client session and the solution implemented to fix it.

## Problem Description

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a `SamplingFnT` type that is used for callback functions that handle sampling events during model generation. However, there was a type compatibility issue when using this type with different versions of the MCP package.

The specific error encountered was:

```
TypeError: Optional[SamplingFnT] is not compatible with Optional[SamplingFnT[...]]
```

This error occurred because:

1. In some versions of the MCP package, `SamplingFnT` is defined as a generic type that requires a type parameter
2. In other contexts, it is used without a type parameter
3. When these two usages are combined, TypeScript's type system flags an incompatibility

## Solution

The solution is to use the TypeScript spread operator (`...`) in the type parameter to make the type more flexible:

```python
# Before:
sampling_callback: Optional[SamplingFnT] = None

# After:
sampling_callback: Optional[SamplingFnT[...]] = None
```

This change allows the `SamplingFnT` type to work with any number of type parameters, making it compatible with different versions of the MCP package and preventing type errors.

## Implementation Details

The fix was applied to several functions in the `_server_utils.py` file that use the `SamplingFnT` type:

1. `connect_to_mcp_server`
2. `connect_to_stdio_mcp_server`
3. `connect_to_sse_mcp_server`

In each function, the parameter type annotation was changed from `Optional[SamplingFnT]` to `Optional[SamplingFnT[...]]`.

## Impact and Benefits

This fix ensures that:

1. The code is compatible with different versions of the MCP package
2. Type checking passes successfully during development and CI/CD
3. The code is more maintainable and less prone to breaking with future updates

## Related Changes

This fix is related to the dynamic VSCode MCP server URL feature ([see documentation](./vscode-mcp-server-dynamic-url.md)), as both improve the robustness of the MCP client session handling. The dynamic URL feature ensures reliable connection to the VSCode MCP server, while this type fix ensures compatibility with different versions of the MCP package.

## Conclusion

By using the TypeScript spread operator in the type parameter, we've created a more flexible and compatible type annotation that resolves the incompatibility issue between different usages of the `SamplingFnT` type.
