# High-Level Plan for AI Assistant Chat Application

This project creates an AI assistant chat experience using a React and TypeScript frontend built with Vite and RTK Query, interacting with a backend Python REST service. We are using Fluent UI React v9 for the UI components to enhance the app's appearance and user experience.

**Development Plan:**

1. **Initialize Project**
   - Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript.
   - Set up project structure for components and services.

2. **Set Up State Management and Styling**
   - Integrate Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for efficient state management and data fetching.

3. **Develop Chat Interface with Fluent UI React**
   - Use Fluent UI React components to create user interface elements for the chat experience.
   - Implement styling and responsiveness using Fluent UI's design system.

4. **Connect to Backend Python REST Service using RTK Query**
   - Configure RTK Query API slices to communicate with the Python REST backend.
   - Ensure secure communication and error handling.

5. **Implement AI Assistant Features**
   - Enable message handling and AI assistant interactions.
   - Process user inputs and display assistant responses.

6. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Prepare the application for deployment and set up CI/CD pipelines.

7. **Final Documentation and README Update**
   - Document the codebase and provide setup instructions. Include details on using pnpm for package management and introducing Fluent UI React components into the project.
   - Update the README with usage guidelines, including commands for package installation and example code for integrating Fluent UI.
 - Encourage contributions by providing guidelines for submitting improvements or new features.

## Folder Structure

The following is the proposed folder structure for the AI assistant chat application:

```
/workspaces-app
|-- /public
|   |-- index.html                # HTML entry point
|   |-- favicon.ico               # Application icon
|
|-- /src
|   |-- /assets                  # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
|   |-- /components              # Reusable React components
|   |   |-- ChatWindow.tsx       # Main chat interface component
|   |   |-- MessageList.tsx      # Component to display chat messages
|   |   `-- MessageInput.tsx     # Input component for sending messages
|   |
|   |-- /contexts                # Context providers for global state
|   |   `-- ThemeContext.tsx     # Example for theming
|   |
|   |-- /features                # RTK slices and features
|   |   |-- chatSlice.ts         # RTK slice for managing chat state
|   |
|   |-- /hooks                   # Custom React hooks
|   |   `-- useChatEvents.ts     # Hook for handling SSE
|   |
|   |-- /services                # API services and configurations
|   |   |-- api.ts               # RTK Query API setup
|   |   `-- sseClient.ts         # SSE client handling
|   |
|   |-- /styles                  # Styling files
|   |   `-- main.css             # Custom global styles
|   |
|   |-- /utils                   # Utility functions and helpers
|   |   `-- helpers.ts           # General purpose helper functions
|   |
|   `-- App.tsx                  # Main application component
|   `-- index.tsx                # Application entry point
|
|-- package.json                 # Package manifest
|-- tsconfig.json                # TypeScript configuration
|-- README.md                    # Project documentation
```

### Highlights of the Structure:

- **`/public`**: Contains static files like `index.html` and others that do not need to be processed by the build tool.
- **`/src/components`**: Dedicated to the individual UI components of your application.
- **`/src/features`**: Contains Redux slices and features for organizing state management.
- **`/src/hooks`**: A place for custom hooks like those handling SSE interactions.
- **`/src/services`**: Service-related code such as API configuration and SSE client handling.
- **`/src/styles`**: Centralized styling files, which could use CSS, SCSS, or CSS-in-JS solutions.
- **`/src/utils`**: Utility functions and helpers shared across the application.

This structure provides separation of concerns and a clear organization that should make future modifications and additions easier.
