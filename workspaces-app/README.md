# High-Level Plan for AI Assistant Chat Application

This project creates an AI assistant chat experience using a React and TypeScript frontend built with Vite and RTK Query, interacting with a backend Python REST service. We are using Fluent UI React v9 for the UI components to enhance the app's appearance and user experience.

**Development Plan:**

1. **Initialize Project**
   - Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript.
   - Set up project structure for components and services.

2. **Set Up State Management and Styling**
   - Integrate Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for efficient state management and data fetching.

3. **Develop Chat Interface with Fluent UI React**
   - Use Fluent UI React components to create user interface elements for the chat experience.
   - Implement styling and responsiveness using Fluent UI's design system.

4. **Connect to Backend Python REST Service using RTK Query**
   - Configure RTK Query API slices to communicate with the Python REST backend.
   - Ensure secure communication and error handling.

5. **Implement AI Assistant Features**
   - Enable message handling and AI assistant interactions.
   - Process user inputs and display assistant responses.

6. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Prepare the application for deployment and set up CI/CD pipelines.

7. **Final Documentation and README Update**
   - Document the codebase and provide setup instructions. Include details on using pnpm for package management and introducing Fluent UI React components into the project.
   - Update the README with usage guidelines, including commands for package installation and example code for integrating Fluent UI.
 - Encourage contributions by providing guidelines for submitting improvements or new features.
