# Create a plan from current context

Create a plan in @ai_working/tmp that can be used by a junior developer to implement the changes needed to complete the task. The plan should be detailed enough to guide them through the implementation process, including any necessary steps, considerations, and references to relevant documentation or code files.

Since they will not have access to this conversation, ensure that the plan is self-contained and does not rely on any prior context. The plan should be structured in a way that is easy to follow, with clear instructions and explanations for each step.

Make sure to include any prerequisites, such as setting up the development environment, understanding the project structure, and any specific coding standards or practices that should be followed and any relevant files or directories that they should focus on. The plan should also include testing and validation steps to ensure that the changes are functioning as expected.

Consider any other relevant information that would help a junior developer understand the task at hand and successfully implement the required changes. The plan should be comprehensive, yet concise enough to be easily digestible.
