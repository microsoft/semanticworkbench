# Conversation Copy Event Investigation - Task Tool Results

## Investigation Method
Used the Task tool to search the entire codebase for conversation copying events and functionality.

## Summary
**There is currently NO specific event for detecting when a conversation is copied/duplicated in the Semantic Workbench codebase.**

## Key Findings

### 1. Available ConversationEventTypes
The system defines these conversation-related events in `/home/robotdad/src/semanticworkbench/libraries/python/semantic-workbench-api-model/semantic_workbench_api_model/workbench_model.py`:
- `conversation_created`
- `conversation_updated` 
- `conversation_deleted`
- Various message and participant events

### 2. Conversation Duplication Implementation
**Backend (lines 929-1114):**
`/home/robotdad/src/semanticworkbench/workbench-service/semantic_workbench_service/controller/assistant.py`
- The `duplicate_conversation` method creates a copy but **does NOT fire any events**
- It copies messages, files, participants, and assistant state
- No `conversation_created` or custom duplication event is triggered

**Frontend:**
`/home/robotdad/src/semanticworkbench/workbench-app/src/components/Conversations/ConversationDuplicate.tsx`
- Uses `useDuplicateConversationMutation` which calls the backend API
- Two duplication modes: same assistants vs cloned assistants

### 3. API Endpoint
**Backend endpoint (line 796):**
`/home/robotdad/src/semanticworkbench/workbench-service/semantic_workbench_service/service.py`
```python
@app.post("/conversations/{conversation_id}")
async def duplicate_conversation(...)
```

**Frontend service (lines 25-36):**
`/home/robotdad/src/semanticworkbench/workbench-app/src/services/workbench/conversation.ts`
```typescript
duplicateConversation: builder.mutation<...>({
    query: (body) => ({
        url: `/conversations/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body: transformConversationForRequest(body),
    }),
})
```

### 4. Event System Gap
The conversation duplication process is a "silent" operation that doesn't notify other parts of the system when a conversation is copied. This differs from other operations like message creation or conversation updates which do fire events.

## Recommendation
If you need to detect conversation copying, you would need to either:
1. Add a new `conversation_duplicated` event type to the system
2. Monitor the conversation list for new conversations with the `imported_from_conversation_id` field set
3. Use the existing `conversation_created` event if it were added to the duplication process

## Investigation Characteristics
- **Comprehensive**: Searched entire codebase
- **Time-consuming**: Required multiple searches across different components
- **Manual correlation**: Had to manually connect findings across files
- **Context switching**: Jumping between different files and directories
