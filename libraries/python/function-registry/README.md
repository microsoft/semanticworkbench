# Function Registry

This library contains classes and utilities helpful for managing the registration of functions to [chat drivers](../chat-driver/README.md) and [skills](../../skills/skill-library/README.md).

These other components generally need utilities such as generating JSON-Schema
of functions, converting strings into function calls,
[context](../context/README.md) passing. These are all generally useful
functions to have when working with "agentic systems" (systems using language
models).
