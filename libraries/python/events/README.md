# Events

These are standard events used by the [Skill
Library](../../skills/skill-library/README.md), [Chat
Driver](../chat-driver/README.md), and other MADE:Exploration projects.

The events here mirror are designed to mirror the event types used in the
[Semantic Workbench](../../semantic-workbench/v1/README.md). Think of these as
the types of events that can be emitted by an assistant and handled by the
workbench.
