# Skills

This is ongoing work by MADE:Exploration related to the idea of "recipes", now
more explicitly defined as "skills".

Skills allow you to create more capable chatbots, a.k.a. assistants.

Read more about our skill library concepts in the [Skill Library README](./skill-library/README.md).

_This_ directory is split into:

- Our [skill library](./skill-library/README.md).
- A set of [skills](./skills/README.md) that can be run by the library.
- Jupyter [notebooks](./notebooks/README.md) that demonstrate using the skill
  library.

Also, see our
[example](../../../assistants/skill-assistant/README.md) of
integrating a skill [assistant](./skill-library/skill_library/assistant.py) into
a Semantic Workbench assistant if that's something you want to try.
