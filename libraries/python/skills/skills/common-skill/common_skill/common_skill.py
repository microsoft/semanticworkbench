1. RunContext gets passed in during execution.
2. Other variables can be passed in during initialization.
3. When a person runs /list_actions, they shouldn't see RunContext or the initialization variables.
4. A person should be able to run an action with params excluding RunContext and inits.
5. The chatdriver should be able to have registered actions without runcontext or init variables. The function that is given to the chatdriver should not have these things.
  A. A chat driver should be able to specify it wants to run a tool call, but the function that executes it should inject a run context?? Or not... the functions themselves might be defined within a context that has a run context.

    Using a class like this might be a good pattern for declaring actions. It
    allows the injection of things while allowing the method signature from
    /list_actions to not need to include them. FOr example, the `gpt_complete`
    method needs a language model, but we can just initialize it to use the
    skill's language model (above).
