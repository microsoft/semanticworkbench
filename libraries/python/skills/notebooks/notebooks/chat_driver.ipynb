      "The future of AI is both exciting and complex, with its trajectory shaped by advances in technology, ethical considerations, and societal needs. As we look ahead, several key themes emerge:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Integration and Personalization**: AI will become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, driving personalized experiences. From healthcare to education, AI systems will tailor recommendations and interventions to individual needs, optimizing outcomes across various sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AI in Healthcare**: We can expect AI to revolutionize the healthcare industry by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining administrative processes, and developing personalized medicine. AI-driven tools could predict diseases, recommend treatments, and even aid in surgical procedures, ultimately improving patient care and reducing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Autonomous Systems**: Autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic systems will become more prevalent, transforming industries like transportation, logistics, and manufacturing. These systems will improve efficiency and safety while also creating new business models and opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ethical and Responsible AI**: As AI systems become more autonomous, the demand for ethical AI frameworks will increase. Ensuring transparency, fairness, accountability, and privacy will be crucial to maintaining public trust. Developing AI systems that align with human values and societal norms will be an ongoing challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **AI and the Workforce**: While AI will automate certain tasks, it will also create new job opportunities and demand an upskilled workforce. It is important to focus on reskilling and education initiatives to prepare the workforce for an AI-augmented future.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **AI in Climate and Sustainability**: AI will play a significant role in addressing climate change and promoting sustainability. From optimizing energy usage and improving agricultural practices to predicting environmental changes, AI could be a critical tool in creating a more sustainable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **AI in Creativity and Arts**: AI is increasingly being used in creative fields, such as music, art, and literature. While it can augment human creativity by offering new tools and perspectives, there will be ongoing discussions about the nature of creativity and authorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **AI Governance and Policy**: With AI's growing influence, policy and regulation will need to keep pace to address issues such as data ownership, algorithmic bias, and national security. International collaboration may be necessary to create coherent frameworks addressing these challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI has the potential to greatly benefit society, but its development requires thoughtful consideration of ethical, social, and economic impacts. As we move forward, collaboration among technologists, policymakers, and the public will be essential to harness AI for the greater good.\n"

Additionally, you can add `tools` to an assistant that enable the assistant to have more interactive capabilities. The tools currently available are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Functions*: Registering local functions with the assistant so it knows it can call them before generating a response. This is a \"hold on let me look that up for you\" kind of interaction.\n",

    "- *Code Interpreter*: Run python code in a secure sandbox.\n",

Let's just let the Chat Completion API be what it is and drive it as necessary as we create our assistants. Let's just wrap up the function calling bits (which, ultimately, can give you the other tools like Functions and File Search) in a simple-to-use GPT-like interface we'll call a *chat driver*.\n",
