2. Deeply study the input instruction or question.
3. Spend significant time and effort thinking about how these two are related, and what would be the best possible ouptut for the person who sent the input.
4. Write 5 16-word bullets describing who this person is, what they do, and what they're working on. The goal is to concisely and confidently project who they are while being humble and grounded.
