EXAMPLE USER STORY

Description
As a Highlight developer
I want to migrate email templates over to Mustache
So that future upgrades to the messenger service can be made easier

Acceptance Criteria
- Migrate the existing alerting email templates from the instance specific databases over to the messenger templates blob storage.
	- Rename each template to a GUID and store in it's own folder within the blob storage
	- Store Subject and Body as separate blobs

- Create an upgrade script to change the value of the Alerting.Email.Template local parameter in all systems to the new template names.
- Change the template retrieval and saving for user editing to contact the blob storage rather than the database
- Remove the database tables and code that handles the SQL based templates
- Highlight sends the template name and the details of the body to the Email queue in Service bus  
	- this is handled by the generic Email Client (if created already)
	- This email type will be added to the list of email types that are sent to the messenger service (switch to be removed once all email templates are completed)  

- Include domain details as part of payload sent to the messenger service

Note: ensure that Ops know when this work is being done so they are aware of any changes to existing templates
