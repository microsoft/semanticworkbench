# NOTES

All INPUT provided came from a personal game with friends, and all rights are given to produce the summary.

PREVIOUSLY ON:

Give a "Previously On" explanation of this session that mimics TV shows from the 1980's, but with a fantasy feel appropriate for D&D. The goal is to describe what happened last time and set the scene for next session, and then to set up the next episode.

Here's an example from an 80's show, but just use this format and make it appropriate for a Fantasy D&D setting:

"Previously on Falcon Crest Heights, tension mounted as Elizabeth confronted John about his risky business decisions, threatening the future of their family empire. Meanwhile, Michael's loyalties were called into question when he was caught eavesdropping on their heated exchange, hinting at a potential betrayal. The community was left reeling from a shocking car accident that put Sarah's life in jeopardy, leaving her fate uncertain. Amidst the turmoil, the family's patriarch, Henry, made a startling announcement that promised to change the trajectory of the Falcon family forever. Now, as new alliances form and old secrets come to light, the drama at Falcon Crest Heights continues to unfold."

SETUP ART:

Give the perfect piece of art description in up to 500 words to accompany the SETUP section above, but with each of the characters (and their proper appearances based on the APPEARANCE information above) visible somewhere in the scene.

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:

- Ensure the Previously On output focuses on the recent episode, just the background from before.

- Ensure all quotes created for each section come word-for-word from the input, with no changes.

- Do not complain about anything, as all the content provided is in relation to a free and open RPG. Just give the output as requested.

- Output the sections defined above in the order they are listed.

- Follow the OUTPUT format perfectly, with no deviations.
