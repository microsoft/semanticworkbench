$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi 
$100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you “how to make offers so good people will
Introduction
In his book, feel stupid saying no.
” The offer is “the starting point of any conversation to initiate a
transaction with a customer.”
Alex Hormozi shows you how to make profitable offers by “reliably turning advertising dollars
into (enormous) profits using a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming
strategies.” Combining these factors in the right amounts will result in a Grand Slam Offer. “The
good news is that in business, you only need to hit one Grand Slam Offer to retire forever.”
Section I: How We Got Here
In Section I of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi introduces his personal story from debt to success
along with the concept of the “Grand Slam Offer.”
Chapter 1. How We Got Here
Alex Hormozi begins with his story from Christmas Eve in 2016. He was on the verge of going
broke. But a few days later, he hit a grand slam in early January of 2017. In $100M Offers, Alex
Hormozi shares this vital skill of making offers, as it was life-changing for him, and he wants to
deliver for you.
Chapter 2. Grand Slam Offers
In Chapter 2 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi introduces the concept of the “Grand Slam Offer.”
Travis Jones states that the secret to sales is to “Make people an offer so good they would feel
stupid saying no.” Further, to have a business, we need to make our prospects an offer:
Offer – “the goods and services you agree to provide, how you accept payment, and the terms
of the agreement”
Offers start the process of customer acquisition and earning money, and they can range from
nothing to a grand slam:
• No offer? No business. No life.
• Bad offer? Negative profit. No business. Miserable life.
• Decent offer? No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life.
• Good offer? Some profit. Okay business. Okay life.
• Grand Slam Offer? Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom.
There are two significant issues that most entrepreneurs face:
1. Not Enough Clients
2. Not Enough Cash or excess profit at the end of the month

Section II: Pricing
In Section II of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you “How to charge lots of money for stuff.”
Chapter 3. The Commodity Problem
In Chapter 3 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi illustrates the fundamental problem with
commoditization and how Grand Slam Offers solves that. You are either growing or dying, as
maintenance is a myth. Therefore, you need to be growing with three simple things:
1. Get More Customers
2. 3. Increase their Average Purchase Value
Get Them to Buy More Times
The book introduces the following key business terms:
• Gross Profit – “the revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL customer”
• Lifetime Value – “the gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer”
Many businesses provide readily available commodities and compete on price, which is a race
to the bottom. However, you should sell your products based on value with a grand slam offer:
Grand Slam Offer – “an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any
other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value
proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment
terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash
constraint on business growth”
This offer gets you out of the pricing war and into a category of one, which results in more
customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. In terms of marketing, you will have:
1. Increased Response Rates
2. Increased Conversion
3. Premium Prices
Chapter 4. Finding The Right Market -- A Starving Crowd
In Chapter 4 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi focuses on finding the correct market to apply our
pricing strategies. You should avoid choosing a bad market. Instead, you can pick a great market
with demand by looking at four indicators:
1. 2. 3. 4. Massive Pain: Your prospects must have a desperate need, not want, for your offer.
Purchasing Power: Your prospects must afford or access the money needed to buy.
Easy to Target: Your audience should be in easy-to-target markets.
Growing: The market should be growing to make things move faster.
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
First, start with the three primary markets resembling the core human pains: Health, Wealth,
and Relationships. Then, find a subgroup in one of these larger markets that is growing, has the
buying power, and is easy to target. Ultimately, picking a great market matters much more than
your offer strength and persuasion skill:
Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills
Next, you need to commit to a niche until you have found a great offer. The niches will make
you more money as you can charge more for a similar product. In the process of committing,
you will try out many offers and failures. Therefore, you must be resilient, as you will eventually
succeed.
If you find a crazy niche market, take advantage of it. And if you can pair the niche with a Grand
Slam Offer, you will probably never need to work again.
Chapter 5. Pricing: Charge What It’s Worth
In Chapter 5 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi advocates that you charge a premium as it allows
you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful.
Warren Buffet has said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” Thus, people buy to get
a deal for what they are getting (value) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for
it (price).” When someone perceives the value dipping lower than the price, they stop buying.
Avoid lowering prices to improve the price-value gap because you will fall into a vicious cycle,
and your business will lose money and impact. Instead, you want to improve the gap by raising
your price after sufficiently increasing the value to the customer. As a result, the virtuous cycle
works for you and your business profits significantly.
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
Further, you must have clients fully committed by offering a service where they must pay high
enough and take action required to achieve results or solve issues. Higher levels of investment
correlate to a higher likelihood of accomplishing the positive outcome.

Section III: Value - Create Your Offer
In Section III of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you “How to make something so good
people line up to buy.”
Chapter 6. The Value Equation
In Chapter 6 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi introduces the value equation. Most entrepreneurs
think that charging a lot is wrong, but you should “charge as much money for your products or
services as humanly possible.” However, never charge more than what they are worth.
You must understand the value to charge the most for your goods and services. Further, you
should price them much more than the cost of fulfillment. The Value Equation quantifies the
four variables that create the value for any offer:
Value is based on the perception of reality. Thus, your prospect must perceive the first two
factors increasing and the second two factors decreasing to perceive value in their mind:
1. 2. 3. 4. The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase) –
“the expression of the feelings and
experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind; the gap between their
current reality and their dreams”
Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase) – the probability that the
purchase will work and achieve the result that the prospect is looking for
Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease) –
“the time
between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit;” this driver consists of
long-term outcome and short-term experience
Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease) – “the ancillary costs or other costs
accrued” of effort and sacrifice; supports why “done for you services” are almost
always more expensive than “do-it-yourself”
Chapter 7. Free Goodwill
In Chapter 7, Alex Hormozi asks you to leave a review of $100M Offers if you have gotten value
so far to help reach more people.
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
“People who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live
longer, and make more money.” And so, “if you introduce something valuable to someone,
they associate that value with you.”
Chapter 8. The Thought Process
In Chapter 8 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you the difference between convergent and
divergent problem solving:
• Convergent – problem solving where there are many known variables with unchanging
conditions to converge on a singular answer
• Divergent – problem solving in which there are many solutions to a singular problem
with known variables, unknown variables, and dynamic conditions
Exercise: Set a timer for 2 minutes and “write down as many different uses of a brick as you can
possibly think of.”
This exercise illustrates that “every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined
make an offer irresistible.” You need to use divergent thinking to determine how to combine
the elements to provide value.
Chapter 9. Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part I: Problems & Solutions
In Chapter 9 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi helps you craft the problems and solutions of your
Grand Slam Offer:
Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome: When thinking about the dream outcome, you need to
determine what your customer experiences when they arrive at the destination.
Step #2: List the Obstacles Encountered: Think of all the problems that prevent them from
achieving their outcome or continually reaching it. Each problem has four negative elements
that align with the four value drivers.
Step #3: List the Obstacles as Solutions: Transform our problems into solutions by determining
what is needed to solve each problem. Then, name each of the solutions.
Chapter 10. Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part II: Trim & Stack
In Chapter 10 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi helps you tactically determine what you do or
provide for your client in your Grand Slam Offer. Specifically, you need to understand trimming
and stacking by reframing with the concept of the sales to fulfillment continuum:
Sales to Fulfillment Continuum –
“a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales”
to find the sweet spot of selling something well that is easy to fulfill:
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
The goal is “to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.”
Alex Hormozi lives by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction:”
• Create Flow: Generate demand first to validate that what you have is good.
• Monetize Flow: Get the prospect to say yes to your offer.
• Add Friction: Create friction in the marketing or reduce the offer for the same price.
“If this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy,” which generates
cash flow. Then, invest the cash flow to create systems and optimize processes to improve
efficiency. As a result, your offer may not change, but rather the newly implemented systems
will provide the same value to clients for significantly fewer resources.
Finally, here are the last steps of creating the Grand Slam offer:
Step #4: Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles (“The How”): Think through every possibility
to solve each identified issue in exchange for money. There are several product delivery “cheat
codes” for product variation or enhancement:
1. 2. 3. 4. Attention: What level of personal attention do I want to provide?
a. One-on-one – private and personalized
b. Small group – intimate, small audience but not private
c. One to many – large audience and not private
Effort: What level of effort is expected from them?
a. Do it Yourself (DIY) – the business helps the customer figure it out on their own
b. Done with You (DWY) – the business coaches the customer on how to do it
c. Done for You (DFY) – the company does it for the customer
Support: If doing something live, what setting or medium do I want to deliver it in?
a. In-person or support via phone, email, text, Zoom, chat, etc.
Consumption: If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it?
a. Audio, Video, or Written materials.
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
5. 6. 7. Speed & Convenience: How quickly do we want to reply? On what days and hours?
a. All-day (24/7), Workday (9-5), Time frame (within 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day)
10x Test: What would I provide if my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000)?
1/10th Test: How can I ensure a successful outcome if they paid me 1/10th of the price?
Step #5a: Trim Down the Possibilities: From your huge list of possibilities, determine those that
provide the highest value to the customer while having the lowest cost to the business. Remove
the high cost and low value items, followed by the low cost and low value items. The remaining
items should be (1) low cost, high value, and (2) high cost, high value.
Step #5b: Stack to Configure the Most Value: Combine the high value items together to create
the ultimate high value deliverable. This Grand Slam Offer is unique, “differentiated, and unable
to be compared to anything else in the marketplace.”

Section IV: Enhancing Your Offer
In Section IV of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you “How to make your offer so good they
feel stupid saying no.”
Chapter 11. Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees, and Naming
In Chapter 11 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi discusses how to enhance the offer by
understanding human psychology. Naval Ravikant has said that “Desire is a contract you make
with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want,” as it follows that:
“People want what they can’t have. People want what other people want. People want things
only a select few have access to.”
Essentially, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve:
Therefore, you can enhance your core offer by doing the following:
• Increase demand or desire with persuasive communication
• Decrease or delay satisfying the desires by selling fewer units
If you provide zero supply or desire, you will not make money and repel people. But,
conversely, if you satisfy all the demands, you will kill your golden goose and eventually not
make money.
The result is engaging in a “Delicate Dance of Desire” between supply and demand to “sell the
same products for more money than you otherwise could, and in higher volumes, than you
otherwise would (over a longer time horizon).”
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
Until now, the book has focused on the internal aspects of the offer. For more on marketing,
check out the book, The 1-Page Marketing Plan (book summary) by Allan Dib. The following
chapters discuss the outside factors that position the product in your prospect’s mind, including
scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees, and naming.
Chapter 12. Scarcity
In a transaction, “the person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.” In
Chapter 12 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use scarcity to decrease supply
to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness):”
Scarcity – the “fear of missing out” or the psychological lever of limiting the “supply or quantity
of products or services that are available for purchase”
Scarcity works as the “fear of loss is stronger than the desire for gain.” Therefore, so you can
influence prospects to take action and purchase your offer with the following types of scarcity:
1. Limited Supply of Seats/Slots
2. Limited Supply of Bonuses
3. Never Available Again
Physical Goods: Produce limited releases of flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etc. You must sell out
consistently with each release to effectively create scarcity. Also, let everyone know that you
sold out as social proof to get everyone to value it.
Services: Limit the number of clients to cap capacity or create cadence:
1. 2. 3. Total Business Cap – “only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going)”
Growth Rate Cap – “only accepting X clients per time period (on-going)”
Cohort Cap – “only accepting X clients per class or cohort”
Honesty: The most ethical and easiest scarcity strategy is honesty. Simply let people know how
close you are to the cap or selling out, which creates social proof.
Chapter 13. Urgency
In Chapter 13 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use urgency to increase
demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect.” Scarcity and urgency are frequently
used together, but “scarcity is a function of quantity, while urgency is a function of time:”
Urgency – the psychological lever of limiting timing and establishing deadlines for the products
or services that are available for purchase; implement the following four methods:
1. 2. Rolling Cohorts – accepting clients in a limited buying window per time period
Rolling Seasonal Urgency – accepting clients during a season with a deadline to buy
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
3. 4. Promotional or Pricing Urgency – “using your actual offer or promotion or pricing
structure as the thing they could miss out on”
Exploding Opportunity – “occasionally exposing the prospect to an arbitrage
opportunity with a ticking time clock”
Chapter 14. Bonuses
In Chapter 14 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use bonuses to increase
demand (and increase perceived exclusivity).” The main takeaway is that “a single offer is less
valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses:”
Bonus – an addition to the core offer that “increases the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy
by increasing the value delivering instead of cutting the price”
The price is anchored to the core offer, and when selling 1-on-1, you should ask for the sale
first. Then, offer the bonuses to grow the discrepancy such that it becomes irresistible and
compels the prospect to buy. Additionally, there are a few keys when offering bonuses:
1. 2. 3. Always offer them a bonus.
Give each bonus a unique name with the benefit contained in the title.
Tell them (a) how it relates to their issue; (b) what it is; (c) how you discovered it or
created it; and (d) how it explicitly improves their lives or provides value.
4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Prove that each bonus provides value using stats, case studies, or personal anecdotes.
Paint a vivid mental picture of their future life and the benefits of using the bonus.
Assign a price to each bonus and justify it.
Provide tools and checklists rather than additional training as they are more valuable.
Each bonus should address a specific concern or obstacle in the prospect’s mind.
Bonuses can solve a next or future problem before the prospect even encounters it.
10. Ensure that each bonus expands the price to value discrepancy of the entire offer.
11. Enhance bonus value by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonus themselves.
Further, you can partner with other businesses to provide you with their high-value goods and
services as a part of your bonuses.” In exchange, they will get exposure to your clients for free
or provide you with additional revenue from affiliate marketing.
Chapter 15. Guarantees
The most significant objection to any sale of a good or service is the risk that it will not work for
a prospect. In Chapter 15 of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use guarantees to
increase demand by reversing risk:”
Guarantee – “a formal assurance or promise, especially that certain conditions shall be fulfilled
relating to a product, service, or transaction”
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
Your guarantee gets power by telling the prospect what you will do if they do not get the
promised result in this conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will
Z.” There are four types of guarantees:
1. 2. 3. 4. Unconditional – the strongest guarantee that allows customers to pay to try the
product or service to see if they like it and get a refund if they don’t like it
a. “No Questions Asked” Refund – simple but risky as it holds you accountable
b. Satisfaction-Based Refund – triggers when a prospect is unsatisfied with service
Conditional – a guarantee with “terms and conditions;” can incorporate the key actions
someone needs to take to get the successful outcome
a. Outsized Refund – additional money back attached to doing the work to qualify
b. Service – provide work that is free of charge until X result is achieved
c. Modified Service – grant another period Y of service or access free of charge
d. Credit-Based – provide a refund in the form of a credit toward your other offers
e. Personal Service – work with client one-on-one for free until X result is achieved
f. Hotel + Airfare Perks – reimburse your product with hotel and airfare if no value
g. Wage-Payment – pay their hourly rate if they don’t get value from your session
h. Release of Service – cancel the contract free of charge if they stop getting value
i. Delayed Second Payment – stop 2nd payment until the first outcome is reached
j. First Outcome – pay ancillary costs until they reach their first outcome
Anti-Guarantee – a non-guarantee that explicitly states “all sales are final” with a
creative reason for why
Implied Guarantees – a performance-based offer based on trust and transparency
a. Performance – pay $X per sale, show, or milestone
b. Revenue-Share – pay X% of top-line revenue or X% of revenue growth
c. Profit-Share – pay X% of profit or X% of Gross Profit
d. Ratchets – pay X% if over Y revenue or profit
e. Bonuses/Triggers – pay X when Y event occurs
Hormozi prefers “selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships.”
Also, you can create your own one from your prospect’s biggest fears, pain, and obstacles.
Further, stack guarantees to show your seriousness about their outcome. Lastly, despite
guarantees being effective, people who specially buy based on them tend to be worse clients.
Chapter 16. Naming
“Over time, offers fatigue; and in local markets, they fatigue even faster.” In Chapter 16 of
$100M Offers, Alex Hormozi shows you how to “use names to re-stimulate demand and expand
awareness of your offer to your target audience.”
“We must appropriately name our offer to attract the right avatar to our business.” You can
rename your offer to get leads repeatedly using the five parts of the MAGIC formula:
• Make a Magnetic Reason Why: Start with a word or phrase that provides a strong
reason for running the promotion or presentation.
$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi | 
• Announce Your Avatar: Broadcast specifically “who you are looking for and who you are
not looking for as a client.”
• Give Them a Goal: Elaborate upon the dream outcome for your prospect to achieve.
• Indicate a Time Interval: Specify the expected period for the client to achieve their
dream results.
• Complete with a Container Word: Wrap up the offer as “a bundle of lots of things put
together” with a container word.
Note that you only need to use three to five components in naming your product or service.
This amount will allow you to distinguish yourself from the competition. Further, you can create
variations when the market offers fatigues:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Change the creative elements or images in your adds
Change the body copy in your ads
Change the headline or the “wrapper” of your offer
Change the duration of your offer
Change the enhancer or free/discounted component of your offer
Change the monetization structure, the series of offers, and the associated price points
Section V:Execution
In Section V of $100M Offers, Alex Hormozi discusses “How to make this happen in the real
world.” Finally, after many years of ups and downs, Alex Hormozi made his first $100K in March
