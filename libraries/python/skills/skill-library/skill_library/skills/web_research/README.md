# Research 2 Skill

This is a second take on a Research Skill. It is a demo of a skill used to do
deep research on a topic and is constructed to mirror the Open Deep Research MCP
functionality as close as possible for a 1:1 comparison. The Open Deep Research
uses an agentic framework (smolagents), so this is kindofa reverse-engineering
of the prompts that get created on an agentic run.
